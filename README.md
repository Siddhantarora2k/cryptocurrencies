# cryptocurrencies

The Goal of this module is to use machine learning with unsupervised learning. This is way different from the supervised learning that we have been dealing with. Some of the newer technologies that we are going to look at are the K-means algorithm, clusters and PCA.

In this case we are going to use unsupervised machine learning with cryptos. We want to group the cryptos to have them classified. Please note that as we are going to use unsupervised learning we really do not know what the output will be. The data will be clustered.
